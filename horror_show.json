	"Tombstones climbing up the sky\n To claim the boredom in the whine of the radiator\n To freeze the fates that intertwine\n Unresolved and undefined in this echo chamber\n Once you've given up the ghost\n Just like Lazarus you'll know there's an operator\n Some strange passenger inside\n To that strange power I'm resigned like an iron anchor\n I'm just a ghost in your stereo\n The fading memory of a shipwreck in the undertow\n You're just a lost song I wrote\n And I'm just a ghost in your stereo\n Ghost\n You move on a thousand times\n New lover's shadows on the blinds\n Your heart's a mercenary\n But like a dancer on the wire\n Come the sparks of frayed desire as the fire's carried\n I'm just a ghost in your stereo\n The fading memory of a shipwreck in the undertow\n You're just a lost song I wrote\n And I'm just a ghost in your stereo\n Ghost\n",
	"Don't fall in love with the man on stage\n I'll be on in a minute\n I'm just sharpening my blade\n Don't fall for his flattering tune\n He'll promise you the world until you drink that perfume\n It's a highway\n Highway to the dark\n And a neon medusa's got your heart\n Sweet canyon lullabies\n Don't look straight into its eyes\n It's a highway\n Highway to the dark\n There's only two ways to make it in this town\n One is to be brilliant\n The other is to drown\n But don't take both drugs all in one go\n You can't reach the heavens passed out on the floor\n It's a highway\n Highway to the dark\n And a neon medusa's got your heart\n Sweet canyon lullabies\n Don't look straight into its eyes\n It's a highway\n Highway to the dark\n If your mama could see you now\n If your mama could see you now\n Topless and upside down\n The room spinning around\n If your mama could see you now\n With the party lines coming out\n Are you lost and are you found?\n Are there too many mirrors in this house?\n Don't fall in love with the man on stage\n I'll be on in a minute\n Then I'll sweep you away\n Don't fall for the monsters in this maze\n But I could love you forever if you'd meet my gaze\n",
	"Called a curse in the cradle\n Loving mother, unstable\n Daddy gone, under the table\n But you found a song in your heart\n So you learned how to fight\n How to starve\n How to survive when the others blocked your light\n You learned to see beyond the stars\n The curse of small desires\n Easily acquired\n It's time to set your gasoline heart on fire\n Kill your demons\n Kill 'em dead\n In your mirror, in your bed\n In your heart, in your head\n Don't you look good in red\n Slay your devils, kill 'em all\n Take your throne, paint the walls\n And if you make it out alive\n Hold that bloody head up high\n Don't you look good in red\n Don't you look good in red\n Is there more beyond those plains?\n You cut your hair, changed your name\n Left a note as you escaped\n To thine own self be true\n But there was no gold in those hills\n No platinum in those pretty pills\n Just werewolves tossing dollar bills\n And the wine dark sea of Malibu\n The curse of small desires\n Easily acquired\n It's time to set your gasoline heart on fire\n Kill your demons\n Kill 'em dead\n In your mirror, in your bed\n In your heart, in your head\n Don't you look good in red\n Slay your devils, kill 'em all\n Take your throne, paint the walls\n And if you make it out alive\n Hold that bloody head up high\n Don't you look good in red?\n Don't you look good in red\n No one's coming to save you\n No one's coming to save you\n Swing that sword that you made\n With the pain that they gave you\n Like the pain is gonna save you\n (Pain is gonna save you)\n Kill your demons\n Kill 'em dead\n In your mirror, in your bed\n In your heart, in your head\n Don't you look good in red\n Slay your devils, kill 'em all\n Take your throne, paint the walls\n And if you make it out alive\n Hold that bloody head up high\n Don't you look good in red\n Don't you look good in red\n",
	"Once there was a man with good intentions\n And some people at home he forgot to mention\n She was looking for a friend and he was willing to listen\n Once was a man with good intentions\n And nobody has to know\n It's alright\n It's alright to let go\n And nobody has to see\n What's between you and me\n Is you and me\n Is you and me\n Is you and me\n Once there was a girl that thought she needed to be saved\n By a white knight on a white horse in a white cape\n And maybe he's taken but you'll take him anyway\n Once there was a girl that thought she needed to be saved\n And nobody has to know\n It's alright\n It's alright to let go\n And nobody has to see\n What's between you and me\n Is you and me\n Is you and me\n Is you and me\n I don't wanna change your mind\n But I don't wanna go home tonight\n Tell me no or I'm coming over\n Let the devil make a deal with the angel on your shoulder\n Is you and me\n Is you and me\n"
