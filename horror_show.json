	"Tombstones climbing up the sky\nTo claim the boredom in the whine of the radiator\n|To freeze the fates that intertwine\nUnresolved and undefined in this echo chamber\n|Once you've given up the ghost\nJust like Lazarus you'll know there's an operator\n|Some strange passenger inside\nTo that strange power I'm resigned like an iron anchor\n|I'm just a ghost in your stereo\nThe fading memory of a shipwreck in the undertow\n|You're just a lost song I wrote\nAnd I'm just a ghost in your stereo\nGhost\n|You move on a thousand times\nNew lover's shadows on the blinds\nYour heart's a mercenary\n|But like a dancer on the wire\nCome the sparks of frayed desire as the fire's carried\n|I'm just a ghost in your stereo\nThe fading memory of a shipwreck in the undertow\n|You're just a lost song I wrote\nAnd I'm just a ghost in your stereo\nGhost\n|",
	"Don't fall in love with the man on stage\nI'll be on in a minute\nI'm just sharpening my blade\n|Don't fall for his flattering tune\nHe'll promise you the world until you drink that perfume\n|It's a highway\nHighway to the dark\nAnd a neon medusa's got your heart\n|Sweet canyon lullabies\nDon't look straight into its eyes\n|It's a highway\nHighway to the dark\n|There's only two ways to make it in this town\nOne is to be brilliant\nThe other is to drown\n|But don't take both drugs all in one go\nYou can't reach the heavens passed out on the floor\n|It's a highway\nHighway to the dark\nAnd a neon medusa's got your heart\n|Sweet canyon lullabies\nDon't look straight into its eyes\n|It's a highway\nHighway to the dark\n|If your mama could see you now\nIf your mama could see you now\n|Topless and upside down\nThe room spinning around\n|If your mama could see you now\nWith the party lines coming out\nAre you lost and are you found?\nAre there too many mirrors in this house?\n|Don't fall in love with the man on stage\nI'll be on in a minute\nThen I'll sweep you away\n|Don't fall for the monsters in this maze\nBut I could love you forever if you'd meet my gaze\n|",
	"Once there was a man with good intentions\nAnd some people at home he forgot to mention\n|She was looking for a friend and he was willing to listen\nOnce was a man with good intentions\n|And nobody has to know\nIt's alright\nIt's alright to let go\n|And nobody has to see\nWhat's between you and me\n|Is you and me\nIs you and me\nIs you and me\n|Once there was a girl that thought she needed to be saved\nBy a white knight on a white horse in a white cape\n|And maybe he's taken but you'll take him anyway\nOnce there was a girl that thought she needed to be saved\n|And nobody has to know\nIt's alright\nIt's alright to let go\n|And nobody has to see\nWhat's between you and me\n|Is you and me\nIs you and me\nIs you and me\n|I don't wanna change your mind\nBut I don't wanna go home tonight\n|Tell me no or I'm coming over\nLet the devil make a deal with the angel on your shoulder\n|Is you and me\nIs you and me\n|",
	"Called a curse in the cradle\nLoving mother, unstable\nDaddy gone, under the table\n|But you found a song in your heart\nSo you learned how to fight\n|How to starve\nHow to survive when the others blocked your light\nYou learned to see beyond the stars\n|The curse of small desires\nEasily acquired\nIt's time to set your gasoline heart on fire\n|Kill your demons\nKill 'em dead\nIn your mirror, in your bed\nIn your heart, in your head\nDon't you look good in red\n|Slay your devils, kill 'em all\nTake your throne, paint the walls\n|And if you make it out alive\nHold that bloody head up high\nDon't you look good in red\nDon't you look good in red\n|Is there more beyond those plains?\nYou cut your hair, changed your name\nLeft a note as you escaped\n|To thine own self be true\nBut there was no gold in those hills\nNo platinum in those pretty pills\n|Just werewolves tossing dollar bills\nAnd the wine dark sea of Malibu\n|The curse of small desires\nEasily acquired\nIt's time to set your gasoline heart on fire\n|Kill your demons\nKill 'em dead\nIn your mirror, in your bed\nIn your heart, in your head\nDon't you look good in red\n|Slay your devils, kill 'em all\nTake your throne, paint the walls\n|And if you make it out alive\nHold that bloody head up high\nDon't you look good in red?\nDon't you look good in red\n|No one's coming to save you\nNo one's coming to save you\n|Swing that sword that you made\nWith the pain that they gave you\n|Like the pain is gonna save you\n(Pain is gonna save you)\n|Kill your demons\nKill 'em dead\nIn your mirror, in your bed\nIn your heart, in your head\nDon't you look good in red\n|Slay your devils, kill 'em all\nTake your throne, paint the walls\n|And if you make it out alive\nHold that bloody head up high\nDon't you look good in red Don't you look good in red\n|"
