	"The city carved a silhouette\nOn the ocean after dark\nOver The lonely and the holy\nAnd the red blood beating hearts\n|Up from the dirty black water\nA shadow void of form\nRaised itself out of the river\nAnd it climbed upon the shore\n|Neon on the black top\nTheres a gentle rain downtown\nThe shadow pooling underneath me\nAs it follows on the ground\n|kissed you when I saw you\nstared deep into your eyes\nI meant to say ‘I love you’\nBut instead I said goodbye\n|Shadows in the city\nI’m a stranger to myself\nOn these streets I’m someone else\n|Shadows in the city\nLike a demon in the dark\nCome to tear us apart (neon on the city)\n|(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n|For all my good intentions\nThere's a shadow in this dark\nIt comes to me infrequently\nAnd breaks your perfect heart\n|I don't know why I do it\n(I) Apologize but it's too Late\nA single tear you leave me here and\nShadow slips away\n|Shadows in the city\nI’m a stranger to myself\nOn these streets I’m someone else\n|Shadows in the city\nLike a demon in the dark\nCome to tear us apart (neon on the city)\n|(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n|(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n|(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n(shadows, downtown)\n(neon on the city)\n",
	"Rush hour\nOn an uptown train\nDoors open\nAs she walks in\n|She’s soaking\nCaught in the rain\nHer skin shines\nCrystalline\n|Eyes meet\nYou know where this goes\nHer key’s in\n|They take off their clothes\nThey’re soaking\nCaught in a dream\n|Her skin shines like\nCrystalline\nThe problem with believers\nThey’ll let anyone in the door\n|The problem with deceivers\nIs all the bodies buried under the floor boards\n|Sailors knew sirens would sing\nFrom rocks off the cliffs by the sea\n|The monsters with waiting teeth\nTheir skin shines\nCrystalline\n|Rush hour\nOn an uptown train\nDoors open\nAs she walks in\n|She’s soaking\nCaught in the rain\nHer skin shines\nCrystalline\n",
	"Glowing windows in the buildings from the elevated train\nI see a thousand different stories pass\nAnd faces without names\n|I forget why I came here\nAnd forget why I stay\n|And wonder if they'd notice\nIf I tried to Slipped away\n|What if I kept going\nWhat if I don't get off tonight\n|What if I ride this to the edges\nThrough the darkness to the light\n|Could I find you there?\nCould I find you there?\nIf I slipped away?\n|What if there's no answer\nWe’re all just hearts that have to fight\n|Through the dangers of the rapids\nThrough the darkness to the light\n|Could I find you there?\nCould I find you there?\nIf I slipped away?\n",
	"I fell in love with the feeling.\nI didn't fall in love with you.\n|There was a song I was singing\nBut it wasn't meant for you\n|And I'm sorry I'm sorry\nThat I can't stay\n|I'm sorry\nWe're light years away\n|I bite your lip\nAnd you taste like summer time\n|I can’t forget\nThe days when you were mine\n|Do you wander the streets every night\nJust to find me too?\n|Lightyears\nEchos\nIn the streetlights\nIn between those\nSpaces in the moment\n|Come and find me\nWhere we let go\nCome and find me\nWhere we let go\n|I fell in love with a feeling\nAnd your funny faces\n|That you were beautiful and broken\nIn all the right places\n|I'm sorry I'm sorry\nThat I can't stay\n|I'm sorry\nWe're light years away\n|Millions behind or lightyears ahead\nOur time is now- our time was then\nAnd I hear your voice inside of my head but - It’s just a silhouette\n|Do you wonder what happened\nTo all of the love we lose?\n|Lightyears\nEchos\nIn the streetlights\nIn between those\nSpaces in the moment\n|Come and find me\nWhere we let go\nCome and find me\nWhere we let go\n|Lightyears\nDo you want your tears back?\nLightyears\nThey’re gone\nI’m sorry\n"
