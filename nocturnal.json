	"The city carved a silhouette\n On the ocean after dark\n Over The lonely and the holy\n And the red blood beating hearts\n| Up from the dirty black water\n A shadow void of form\n Raised itself out of the river\n And it climbed upon the shore\n| Neon on the black top\n Theres a gentle rain downtown\n The shadow pooling underneath me\n As it follows on the ground\n| kissed you when I saw you\n stared deep into your eyes\n I meant to say ‘I love you’\n But instead I said goodbye\n| Shadows in the city\n I’m a stranger to myself\n On these streets I’m someone else\n| Shadows in the city\n Like a demon in the dark\n Come to tear us apart (neon on the city)\n| (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n| For all my good intentions\n There's a shadow in this dark\n It comes to me infrequently\n And breaks your perfect heart\n| I don't know why I do it\n (I) Apologize but it's too Late\n A single tear you leave me here and\n Shadow slips away\n| Shadows in the city\n I’m a stranger to myself\n On these streets I’m someone else\n| Shadows in the city\n Like a demon in the dark\n Come to tear us apart (neon on the city)\n| (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n| (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n| (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n (shadows, downtown)\n (neon on the city)\n|",
	"Rush hour\n On an uptown train\n Doors open\n As she walks in\n| She’s soaking\n Caught in the rain\n Her skin shines\n Crystalline\n| Eyes meet\n You know where this goes\n Her key’s in\n| They take off their clothes\n They’re soaking\n Caught in a dream\n| Her skin shines like\n Crystalline\n The problem with believers\n They’ll let anyone in the door\n| The problem with deceivers\n Is all the bodies buried under the floor boards\n| Sailors knew sirens would sing\n From rocks off the cliffs by the sea\n| The monsters with waiting teeth\n Their skin shines\n Crystalline\n| Rush hour\n On an uptown train\n Doors open\n As she walks in\n| She’s soaking\n Caught in the rain\n Her skin shines\n Crystalline\n|",
	"Glowing windows in the buildings from the elevated train\n I see a thousand different stories pass\n And faces without names\n| I forget why I came here\n And forget why I stay\n| And wonder if they'd notice\n If I tried to Slipped away\n| What if I kept going\n What if I don't get off tonight\n| What if I ride this to the edges\n Through the darkness to the light\n| Could I find you there?\n Could I find you there?\n If I slipped away?\n| What if there's no answer\n We’re all just hearts that have to fight\n| Through the dangers of the rapids\n Through the darkness to the light\n| Could I find you there?\n Could I find you there?\n If I slipped away?\n|",
	"I fell in love with the feeling.\n I didn't fall in love with you.\n| There was a song I was singing\n But it wasn't meant for you\n| And I'm sorry I'm sorry\n That I can't stay\n| I'm sorry\n We're light years away\n| I bite your lip\n And you taste like summer time\n| I can’t forget\n The days when you were mine\n| Do you wander the streets every night\n Just to find me too?\n| Lightyears\n Echos\n In the streetlights\n In between those\n Spaces in the moment\n| Come and find me\n Where we let go\n Come and find me\n Where we let go\n| I fell in love with a feeling\n And your funny faces\n| That you were beautiful and broken\n In all the right places\n| I'm sorry I'm sorry\n That I can't stay\n| I'm sorry\n We're light years away\n| Millions behind or lightyears ahead\n Our time is now- our time was then\n And I hear your voice inside of my head but - It’s just a silhouette\n| Do you wonder what happened\n To all of the love we lose?\n| Lightyears\n Echos\n In the streetlights\n In between those\n Spaces in the moment\n| Come and find me\n Where we let go\n Come and find me\n Where we let go\n| Lightyears\n Do you want your tears back?\n Lightyears\n They’re gone\n I’m sorry\n|"
