	"I break like glass\n You break like waves on the ocean, on the ocean\n| I tend to crash\n And you have to deal with the explosion, though I know that\n| Everything will always be exactly how it's gonna be\n Though I seem to worry every single day\n| This prodigal turns home again then morning comes and in the end\n I see that new sun shining on your face\n| We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n| I sink like stone\n You seem to flow above the madness like wings on canvas\n| And all that I know\n Is that I hear the notes through the darkness like a promise\n| Everything will always be exactly how it’s gonna be\n Though I seem to worry every single day\n| This prodigal turns home again then morning comes and in the end\n I see that new sun shining on your face\n| We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n| We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n|",
	"He spoke of the truth and how it might save her\n And she spoke of the trees in Vermont in the winter\n| He said we must strive for faith through devotion\n While she dreams of the smell of the Indian Ocean\n| He spoke in philosophical structure\n She spoke of a vineyard, she spoke of her lover\n| When he does not understand\n You can hear bones breaking in his head\n When she does not understand\n| Sometimes she smiles\n When he does not understand\n You can hear bones breaking in his head\n When she does not understand\n| Sometimes she smiles\n He said reason is what separates man from the beasts\n And she kissed him and put him at ease\n|"
