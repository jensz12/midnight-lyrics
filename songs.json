["One, two, three, four \n Fire on the beach \n Face to the sky \n The stars dance around like Gods in the skies \n The gold silhoutte \n You take off your clothes \n And my heart feels the weight of all I don't know\n  Memories and mountain tops \n Drunk on sunset boulevard \n With the city of angels singing on \n Maybe this is just a dream \n And maybe we are still asleep \n But I, I will miss you when I'm gone \n Flickers of the canyon fire \n It's hands raised like a gospel choir \n If we live forever, let us live forever tonight \n Helicopters against moonlight \n Our holy mother of the midnight \n And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight \n Tomorrow we'll go \n Back to our lives \n With sand in our skin and sun in our eyes \n But I know the truth \n I've seen the signs \n And I've seen the golden Gods in disguise \n Memories and mountain tops \n Drunk on sunset boulevard \n With the city of angels singing on \n Maybe this is just a dream \n And maybe we are still asleep \n But I, I will miss you when I'm gone \n Flickers of the canyon fire \n It's hands raised like a gospel choir \n If we live forever, let us live forever tonight \n Helicopters against moonlight \n Our holy mother of the midnight \n And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight \n Flickers of the canyon fire \n It's hands raised like a gospel choir \n If we live forever, let us live forever tonight \n Helicopters against moonlight \n Our holy mother of the midnight \n And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight \n Flickers of the canyon fire \n It's hands raised like a gospel choir \n If we live forever, let us live forever tonight \n Helicopters against moonlight \n Our holy mother of the midnight \n And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight", "The top shelf tumbles and the world clocks run\n The west scotch bottles and the soda guns\n You missed the last train from the city tonight\n Old friends see each other in a different, different light\n You missed the last train tonight\n The alphabet city as dive bares drone\n And two pilgrims seek a makeshift home\n Missed the last train from the city tonight\n Old friends see each other in a different, different light\n You missed the last train tonight\n There is a song, singin' in the dark\n Don't get too close, it'll tear you apart\n There is a reason for every season of the heart\n There is a song, singin' in the fire\n Don't get too close, it cuts like a wire\n There is a reason for every season of desire\n The subway rumbles under Union Square\n And the morning finds an unlikely pair\n Hotel lobby holding hands\n Don't blink, don't think, don't look in her eyes\n Is this for forever or is this goodbye?\n Goodbye\n There is a song, singin' in the dark\n Don't get too close, it'll tear you apart\n There is a reason for every season of the heart\n There is a song, singin' in the fire\n Don't get too close, it cuts like a wire\n There is a reason for every season of desire\n Half in light and half in dark\n Is where we start\n Half in light and half in dark\n Is where we are\n Half in light and half in dark\n Is where we start\n Half in light and half in dark\n Is where we are\n We are one beating heart\n We are one beating heart\n We are one beating heart"]
