	"I break like glass\n You break like waves on the ocean, on the ocean\n\s I tend to crash\n And you have to deal with the explosion, though I know that\n\s Everything will always be exactly how it's gonna be\n Though I seem to worry every single day\n\s This prodigal turns home again then morning comes and in the end\n I see that new sun shining on your face\n\s We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n\s I sink like stone\n You seem to flow above the madness like wings on canvas\n\s And all that I know\n Is that I hear the notes through the darkness like a promise\n\s Everything will always be exactly how it’s gonna be\n Though I seem to worry every single day\n\s This prodigal turns home again then morning comes and in the end\n I see that new sun shining on your face\n\s We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n\s We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n We begin to bend\n We begin to mend\n\s",
	"He spoke of the truth and how it might save her\n And she spoke of the trees in Vermont in the winter\n\s He said we must strive for faith through devotion\n While she dreams of the smell of the Indian Ocean\n\s He spoke in philosophical structure\n She spoke of a vineyard, she spoke of her lover\n\s When he does not understand\n You can hear bones breaking in his head\n When she does not understand\n\s Sometimes she smiles\n When he does not understand\n You can hear bones breaking in his head\ When she does not understand\n\s Sometimes she smiles\n He said reason is what separates man from the beasts\n And she kissed him and put him at ease\n\s"
