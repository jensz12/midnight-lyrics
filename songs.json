	"He spoke of the truth and how it might save her\nAnd she spoke of the trees in Vermont in the winter\n|He said we must strive for faith through devotion\nWhile she dreams of the smell of the Indian Ocean\n|He spoke in philosophical structure\nShe spoke of a vineyard, she spoke of her lover\n|When he does not understand\nYou can hear bones breaking in his head\nWhen she does not understand\n|Sometimes she smiles\nWhen he does not understand\nYou can hear bones breaking in his head\nWhen she does not understand\n|Sometimes she smiles\nHe said reason is what separates man from the beasts\nAnd she kissed him and put him at ease\n|"
