	"I made my home in a ten-ton bomb\n And I was so happy with 28 years of free fallin’\n But now it’s all guts and I’m bawlin'\n She was born in a tenement walk-up\n With shit for nerves, you know she never learned to talk to adults\n She said ‘everything's easier in here’\n Like the dancer with bruises who gathers the cash\n When the music is through, no she don’t look back\n I’ve come to look for America too\n All I ever wanted was a spot in the mountains\n With an a-frame cabin and nobody counting our days\n Or cursing or praising our name\n But the best we could do is to enter the void\n Like a wide-eyed child waking up to the noise of East Harlem\n Don’t they see that we’re starving?\n Like the dancer with bruises who gathers the cash\n When the music is through no she don’t look back\n I’ve come to look for America too\n And we stole the car on the 4th of July\n I pawned my guitar and we drove through the night\n I’ve come to look for America too\n",
	"We are not a sentimental age\n We don’t want our parent’s china or their ticker tape parade\n We are not a sentimental age\n We’re out getting high on fire escapes\n We are hooking up with strangers we will never see again\n We are not a sentimental age\n But when I dream, we’re all melting together\n Synchronized in a mass embrace\n Beads of water folding together\n Like a north shore wave\n How strange\n We’re parts of each other how strange\n I’ll never even know your name\n We are not a sentimental age\n On our shoulders is a boulder of a debt we cannot pay\n We are not a sentimental age\n Diagnosis says I tend to disengage\n I’d rather have my privacy, I’d rather have my space\n These are just the pills I have to take\n We are not a sentimental age\n But when I dream, we’re all melting together\n Synchronized in a mass embrace\n Beads of water folding together\n Like a north shore wave\n How strange\n We’re parts of each other how strange\n I’ll never even know your name\n",
	"The kids are sad\n The sky is blue\n There are monsters in the spare bedroom\n Kids grow up\n And move away\n They closed the plant\n Then the mall arcade\n The kids are sad\n Their Parents too\n Kids get high in the spare bedroom\n We grow up\n And move away\n The seasons pass but the monsters stay\n",
	"We were the monsters and fire-breathers\n We were the quiet sunrise leavers\n You were a good girl, what could I do?\n I was a lost boy when I met you\n Hold me til I’m not lonely anymore\n It’s only the crashing of the ocean to the shore\n Because in the dark there are no strangers,\n There are no strangers at all\n We were the rebels, lone survivors\n We were the cult of deep sea divers\n We were young once then we grew old\n We were shining, we were fool's gold\n Hold me till I’m not lonely anymore\n It’s only the crashing of the ocean to the shore\n Because in the dark there are no strangers,\n There are no strangers at all\n",
	"To the freedom fighters, to the everest climbers, to the castaways\n To the midnight riders, to the spark igniters, I am on my way\n Let it be said, and let it be known,\n he who is free is never alone\n The path before us, the world behind us\n I’ll wait for you there\n To the lost ark raiders, to the lion tamers, to the stowaway\n To the white tide chaser, to the black flag raiser, I’m on my way\n Let it be said, and let it be known,\n he who is free is never alone\n The path behind us, the world before us\n I’ll wait for you there\n There’s a song that sailors know\n Lost, alone and far from home\n Golden gallions. golden guns\n And find that place under the sun\n There’s a song on the Sahara wind\n That lifts you to your feet again\n That dances on the clockwork stars\n That pulses through a beating heart\n"
