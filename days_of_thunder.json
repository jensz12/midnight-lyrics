	"Shy kid, knees always bruised\n The daddy's girl that became you\n\s In the front seat, you pulled me close\n Kissed my lips, it tasted like home\n\s Flashes of crosswords and chamomile\n The years pass like a Ferris Wheel\n\s The tiny fractures in the form\n The days we live are so much more\n\s We got a little place near the beach\n We watch the sailboats out at sea\n And we ride along the Palisades\n\s Love is just a summer day\n If you hold too tight it starts to fade\n\s Let it go then, then it floats away\n In time will you remember me\n\s For a second we had everything\n Half awake and sunburned…\n\s Searching vines of summer…\n Aimless and upwards…\n\s",
