	"Shy kid, knees always bruised\n The daddy's girl that became you\n| In the front seat, you pulled me close\n Kissed my lips, it tasted like home\n| Flashes of crosswords and chamomile\n The years pass like a Ferris Wheel\n| The tiny fractures in the form\n The days we live are so much more\n| We got a little place near the beach\n We watch the sailboats out at sea\n And we ride along the Palisades\n| Love is just a summer day\n If you hold too tight it starts to fade\n| Let it go then, then it floats away\n In time will you remember me\n| For a second we had everything\n Half awake and sunburned…\n| Searching vines of summer…\n Aimless and upwards…\n|",
	"Oh, Gloria\n I feel so much better\n I feel so much better today\n| And it's not the drugs\n And it's not the weather\n I just feel so much better today\n| I've been asleep in the driver's seat\n I've been lost in my head for weeks\n Tryin' to find what it is I need\n Too god damned tired to sleep\n| And then there were other times\n I'm so aware that I lose my mind\n| And that I feel I could get enough\n So high that I can't stand up\n| Oh, Gloria\n I feel so much better\n I feel so much better today\n| And it's not the drugs\n And it's not the weather\n I just feel so much better today\n| There are those who will never learn\n Who build a fire and can't stay warm\n| The only secret to make it through\n Is to take what's in front of you\n| The fear of death and the thrill of speed\n And all the lights in front of me\n| Drive 'til the coast is clear\n Faster 'til it disappears\n| Oh, Gloria\n I feel so much better\n I feel so much better today\n| And it's not the drugs\n And it's not the weather\n I just feel so much better today\n| Oh, Gloria\n I feel so much better\n I feel so much better today\n| And it's not the drugs\n And it's not the weather\n I just feel so much better today\n| Oh, Gloria\n I feel so much better\n I feel so much better today\n| And it's not the drugs\n And it's not the weather\n I just feel so much better today\n| I've been asleep in the driver's seat\n I've been lost in my head for weeks\n Tryin' to find what it is I need\n Too god damned tired to sleep\n|",
	"Sun in my eyes and the gold coast shining\n And the girl with the braids in her hair\n| Steady breeze and oh I was falling\n I would follow her anywhere\n| The sky turned grey in a flash flood warning\n She smiled and she took my hand\n| She kissed my lips and the rain came pouring\n Swore I heard a marching band\n| WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n| Hanging out of the third story window\n Oh you were a sight to see\n| The black dress that bends when the wind blows\n Roll back the tide for me\n| WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n| WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n WeMoveForward\n ‘Cause we can't go back\n| Sunset skies, the paint is peeling, the wind blowing sand in her hair\n Endless days in the deep blue feeling\n I would follow her anywhere\n|",
	"Love is a setting sun\n Is a smoking gun\n Is a four letter word\n I hope it hurts\n| Love is a fatal flaw\n Is a broken jaw\n Is a burning bridge\n Move your hips\n| And the ghost of the boulevard\n Littered with lonely hearts\n The city like a graveyard\n Once was a postcard\n| When you lose your wonder\n And you can't remember\n When we were living\n In the days of thunder\n| Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of\n| Love was a dream to have\n Was a king-size bed\n Was an escape plan\n Was an open hand\n| Now it's a dog from hell\n It's a dream you sell\n It's an epitaph\n It's photograph\n| And the ghost of the boulevard\n Littered with lonely hearts\n The city like a graveyard\n Once was a postcard\n| When you lose your wonder\n And you can't remember\n When we were living\n In the days of thunder\n| Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of\n| Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of thunder\n Living in the days of\n|",
