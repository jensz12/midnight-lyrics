	"The top shelf tumbles and the world clocks run\n The west scotch bottles and the soda guns\n You missed the last train from the city tonight\n Old friends see each other in a different, different light\n You missed the last train tonight\n The alphabet city as dive bares drone\n And two pilgrims seek a makeshift home\n Missed the last train from the city tonight\n Old friends see each other in a different, different light\n You missed the last train tonight\n There is a song, singin' in the dark\n Don't get too close, it'll tear you apart\n There is a reason for every season of the heart\n There is a song, singin' in the fire\n Don't get too close, it cuts like a wire\n There is a reason for every season of desire\n The subway rumbles under Union Square\n And the morning finds an unlikely pair\n Hotel lobby holding hands\n Don't blink, don't think, don't look in her eyes\n Is this for forever or is this goodbye?\n Goodbye\n There is a song, singin' in the dark\n Don't get too close, it'll tear you apart\n There is a reason for every season of the heart\n There is a song, singin' in the fire\n Don't get too close, it cuts like a wire\n There is a reason for every season of desire\n Half in light and half in dark\n Is where we start\n Half in light and half in dark\n Is where we are\n Half in light and half in dark\n Is where we start\n Half in light and half in dark\n Is where we are\n We are one beating heart\n We are one beating heart\n We are one beating heart",

	"There’s traffic on the bridge\n But the skyline shines with a certain light\n And I know you’re sick of it\n But I know a happy hour nearby\n And there’s a possibility\n That one day things will get better for\n The huddled masses in between\n The shadows and the stars\n Floating empire Held up by fraying wire\n I’ll cover you in winter like a blanket by the fire\n And when the rent is too high\n We’ll just buy cheaper wine\n And hang on to see if whether\n Constellations hold together or not\n Four years in Brooklyn\n And happy birthday darling\n When we feel young again\n I’d like to take you dancing\n Cause there’s a possibility\n That one day things will get better\n For the huddled masses in between\n The shadows and the stars\n And there’s a possibility\n That we’ll both go down together\n Or free ourselves from gravity\n And tumble through the dark\n Floating empire\n Held up by fraying wire\n I’ll cover you in winter like a blanket by the fire\n And when the rent is too high\n We’ll just buy cheaper wine\n And hang on to see if whether\n Constellations hold together or not\n I never placed too much faith in the stars\n I never placed too much faith in my heart\n But the siren call of the chandelier city\n And inch by inch we’re breaking apart\n As we’re rising through the dark\n From the sky I bet the lights look pretty\n Floating empire\n Held up by fraying wire\n I’ll cover you in winter like a blanket by the fire\n And when the rent is too high\n We’ll just buy cheaper wine\n And hang on to see if whether\n Constellations hold together or not\n",

	"I was busy dreaming\n Building us a world\n Day dreaming up a good life\n That wouldn’t hurt and wouldn’t spoil\n The sun never set there\n The water, clean and pure\n In the beauty there was purpose\n So certain, safe and sure\n I could’ve lived this lie forever\n But from far far away\n I thought I heard you calling\n You said I could not stay\n And I woke up in a fever\n My calculations were wrong\n These pillars could not hold us\n And the angels were gone\n When hope makes you bleed\n When life gets you down\n There’s all the love you need\n Underground\n To make a way for the dark heart\n To feel the love I’ve found\n There’s all the love you need\n Underground\n We dream away…\n A picture of a sunset\n Above a turquoise tide\n The beauty of a just world\n And the convenience of a lie\n I tore down that picture\n There is no other perfect life\n But in the dirt under my fingers\n Maybe something will survive\n When hope makes you bleed\n When life gets you down\n There’s all the love you need\n Underground\n To make a way for the dark heart\n To feel the love I’ve found\n There’s all the love you need\n Underground\n We dream away…\n",
	"I wasn’t looking for forever or a one night stand\n I was just hoping for a smile or a quick slow dance\n But when I saw you, there was nothing I could ever do\n To ignore the smell of smoke across the room\n I’ve had my mistakes\n But my heart was clean\n But I’m made of matches\n You’re made of gasoline\n The room around began to catch fire and disappear\n Fighting fire with flames\n If I burn down would you do the same\n You tell me it’s wrong\n But we’re both to blame\n I wasn’t looking for a sign\n When I touched you your skin was hot and eyes were clear\n And the room around began to catch fire and disappear\n I told my heart that I would keep it safe and locked away\n But I found myself walking to you through the flame\n I saw the flashes\n I saw the fire grow\n I saw the ember\n I saw the cinder smoke\n The room around began to catch fire and disappear\n I see fire in the sky\n",
