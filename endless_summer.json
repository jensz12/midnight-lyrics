	"Should have known at the end of summer\n The innocence fades and the weak become stronger\n\s Should have known at the end of the summer\n I'd be lost without you\n\s The skyline looked like a stained glass window\n The city sang such mad crescendo\n\s Four bare feet on a rain soaked street\n Summer airbrushed fever dreams\n\s Disappeared in a camera flash\n Why do the bad girls never last\n\s Lost in gin and lemonade\n Electrospins and the mermaid parade\n\s Four quartets and no regrets\n Except for the polaroids i left\n\s You were just some spell i was under\n That endless summer\n\s",
	"Faked our deaths\n Lit a match\n Closed the door\n Waited for the flash\n\s Greyhound station\n Paid in cash\n Miss lazarus\n We're coming back\n\s They say it's darkest before the dawn\n We've been in this town for far too long\n They say it's darkest before the dawn\n We're moving on\n\s Sunset\n No regrets\n First chance\n Last dance\n Stuck in the middle\n\s Even bad girls\n Know good love\n You taste so sweet\n It hurts a little\n\s Make our home\n Where we stand\n One suitcase\n And half a plan\n\s Follow the wolves\n And sing along\n Past the voices\n To the Song\n\s They say it's darkest before the dawn\n We've been in this town for far too long\n They say it's darkest before the dawn\n We're moving on\n\s Sunset\n No regrets\n First chance\n Last dance\n Stuck in the middle\n\s Even bad girls\n Know good love\n You taste so sweet\n It hurts a little\n",

	"Strangers in a dark room, laughing at jokes they didn't quite hear\n Frosted window panes and cheap champagne a face appears\n\s And anything could happen in these cathedrals we roam\n Where shadow people dance and trade their glance and walk home alone\n\s She's staring out the window of the Roosevelt Hotel\n Watching midtown empty out and I kiss her farewell\n\s They say we come from nothing and to nothing we'll return\n And in between is gravity and bridges left to burn\n\s",
