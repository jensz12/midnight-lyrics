	"Should have known at the end of summer\n The innocence fades and the weak become stronger\n Should have known at the end of the summer\n I'd be lost without you\n The skyline looked like a stained glass window\n The city sang such mad crescendo\n Four bare feet on a rain soaked street\n Summer airbrushed fever dreams\n Disappeared in a camera flash\n Why do the bad girls never last\n Lost in gin and lemonade\n Electrospins and the mermaid parade\n Four quartets and no regrets\n Except for the polaroids i left\n You were just some spell i was under\n That endless summer\n",
